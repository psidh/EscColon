        How to Reduce Plastic Waste
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental challenges we face
        today. Reducing plastic usage in our daily lives can significantly
        impact our planet's health. Here are some practical tips and strategies
        to minimize plastic waste and contribute to a sustainable future.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        1. Carry Reusable Bags
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Say no to single-use plastic bags by keeping reusable cloth or jute bags
        with you. They are durable, eco-friendly, and perfect for shopping.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        2. Use Refillable Bottles and Cups
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Invest in a reusable water bottle and coffee cup. Many cafes offer
        discounts if you bring your own cup, and refillable bottles reduce the
        need for plastic water bottles.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        3. Avoid Plastic Packaging
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Opt for products with minimal or no plastic packaging. Choose items sold
        in glass, paper, or metal containers, which are easier to recycle.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        4. Say No to Plastic Straws and Utensils
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Use metal or bamboo straws and carry your own set of utensils when
        eating out. These small changes can help reduce a significant amount of
        single-use plastics.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        5. Recycle Properly
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Educate yourself about local recycling guidelines and ensure you're
        disposing of plastic waste correctly. Rinse and clean plastic containers
        before recycling to avoid contamination.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        6. Support Plastic-Free Businesses
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Choose to shop from brands and businesses that are committed to reducing
        plastic usage. Supporting sustainable companies encourages more
        businesses to follow suit.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        7. Educate and Inspire Others
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Share your knowledge and inspire friends and family to join the fight
        against plastic pollution. Collective efforts amplify impact and promote
        a culture of sustainability.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        Final Thoughts
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Reducing plastic waste is not just an individual responsibility; it's a
        collective movement. By incorporating these simple changes into your
        lifestyle, you can be part of the solution to this global issue.
        Together, we can protect our planet for future generations.
