        Conserving Wildlife and Marine Life
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Wildlife and marine life are essential to the health of our planet.
        Preserving these ecosystems helps maintain biodiversity and ensures the
        survival of countless species. Here are some impactful strategies to
        conserve wildlife and marine life and make a positive difference.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        1. Support Wildlife Sanctuaries and Marine Reserves
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Donate to or volunteer with organizations that protect wildlife habitats
        and marine reserves. These spaces provide safe environments for species
        to thrive away from human threats.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        2. Reduce Ocean Pollution
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Limit your use of single-use plastics, dispose of waste responsibly, and
        participate in beach cleanups. Reducing pollution protects marine life
        from ingesting or becoming entangled in debris.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        3. Practice Sustainable Tourism
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Choose eco-friendly tourism options that prioritize conservation
        efforts. Avoid activities that exploit wildlife, such as riding
        elephants or swimming with captive dolphins.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        4. Advocate for Stronger Conservation Policies
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Support policies and legislation aimed at protecting endangered species
        and critical habitats. Voice your support for initiatives that combat
        climate change and overfishing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        5. Reduce Carbon Footprint
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Climate change is a significant threat to both terrestrial and marine
        ecosystems. Reduce your carbon footprint by using renewable energy,
        carpooling, and consuming less meat and dairy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        6. Support Ethical Seafood Choices
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Choose sustainably sourced seafood to help prevent overfishing and
        ensure marine populations remain healthy. Look for certifications like
        MSC or ASC on seafood products.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        7. Educate and Inspire Others
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
        Spread awareness about the importance of conservation efforts. Share
        knowledge and encourage your community to take action to protect
        wildlife and marine ecosystems.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">
        Final Thoughts
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-4">
